### An investigation into the impacts of the N501Y variant, population immunity and vaccine distribution strategies on COVID-19 spread

This project was done as part of the L48 (Machine Learning and the Real World) course in the Computer Science Tripos at University of Cambridge. It extends the TTI-Simulator written by DELVE (https://github.com/rs-delve/tti-explorer/) to introduce and analyse effects of the N501Y variant, population immunity and vaccination to the R rates and mortality rate.

To run the simulator, look at: 'tti/notebooks/Preprocessing Notebook.ipynb' and 'tti/notebooks/Testing Notebook.ipynb' which contain all the required code.
